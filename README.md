# Uber-Data-Engineering-Project-with-GCP-Modern-Tools
Developed a modern data engineering project on the Uber dataset using Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Built a data model in fact and dimension format, transformed the data using Python, deployed the code on a compute instance, loaded the data onto BigQuery, and created a final dashboard for data analysis and visualization.
